Abstract
Bioinformatics skills required for genome sequencing often represent a significant hurdle for many researchers working in
computational biology. This humble effort highlights the significance of genome assembly as a research area, focuses on its
need to remain accurate, provides details about the characteristics of the raw data, examines some key metrics, emphasizes
some tools and draws attention to a generic tutorial with example data that outlines the whole pipeline for next-generation
sequencing. The article concludes by pointing out some major future research problems.
Key words: genome assembly; next-generation sequencing; comparative assembly; de novo assembly; de-Bruijn graphs;
